## Development Notes

Since this repository currently only contains the specification document, future development should:

1. Review the full specification in `34yyOc0R8GzGwjR0cJgB_doc.md` before starting implementation
2. Follow the specified color palette and design guidelines closely
3. Implement the site structure as outlined in the sitemap (sections 2-3 of spec)
4. Ensure all functional requirements from section 4 are met
5. Test across the specified browser and device requirements (section 5)

The specification document contains detailed information about content requirements, technical stack recommendations, and success metrics that should guide the implementation process.
